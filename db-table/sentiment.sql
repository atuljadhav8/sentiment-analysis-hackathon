471	2017-05-18		I worked at Travelex	Sales Consultant	The company is a fantastic company to work for.  Most staff are excellent, friendly but you can get some trouble makers as in any industries. Pay was fair compared to other jobs and its not a difficult job to do. All Team leaders and managers were great. Basically you work by yourself and no one around to stress you out.	I found that most stores were not designed correctly to allow staff to work comfortably. Chairs, desks, equipment too old and caused problems all the time.\r\nStores need to be cleaned all the time and it was always a few staff members that would be constantly doing this. This is not the companies fault, this is the staff that are purely unwilling  to clean which in any other industries is unheard of.	Keep your stores up to standard.

Anything short of the owner losing the contract with Charlotte Douglas International Airport which would allow for corporate to potentially take over and clean house on management, it's impossible to salvage this location due to the complete lack of accountability at the top	0	0	\N	\N	0.4	2.6	-0.1	1.2	0.92
439	2018-02-09		I worked at Travelex part-time for more than a year	Former Employee - Travel Money Advisor	Easy work when you’re trained and can work fast, can just spend your spare time sat on computer doing whatever you like. \n\nWorking alone was great at times when you’re not in the mood for talking. \n\nGreat sense of responsibility handling such large amounts of money.	This really depends on your immediate manager and how they plan shifts. My manager chose to put me on the weekend shifts every week for months and no matter how many times I asked to change this and accommodate my hours so I worked in the week sometimes instead, this never happened. \n\nIf staff leave/go on sick in my experience as they weren’t quick to recruit new staff, this workload is all put on you.\n\nNature of...	Area managers should take a closer look at shift patterns and see whether managers and other employees are doing their fair share of unsociable hours. Also should recruit as soon as employees go on sick rather than leaving this problem to develop and then putting all that work on one employee.	0	0	\N	\N	0.8	2.4	-0.1	1.6	1.7599999999999998
454	2017-10-18		I worked at Travelex  for more than a year	Travel Money Advisor	An okay job if you don't mind working alone and feel you can grasp all aspects of the role. You have to be methodical and be capable of using your initiative because there's a significant chance you'll have no one to ask for help.	Can be lonely on your own, especially when busy and you have a queue of people waiting and you're dealing with large wads of cash. \r\nManagement tend to hire anyone in order to have people to cover shifts - they're usually not the ones training them so why do they need to worry! Training incompetent people was the final nail in it for me. \r\nI was hired for 20 hours but ended up working full time because we never had...	Check in with your team members every now and again.

480	2017-03-22		I worked at Travelex full-time for more than 5 years	Former Employee - Team Leader	The job itself is interesting and variable\nLocal teams are great to work with	Management structure changes to the detriment of staff interest\nCommunication from management at times has little to be desired.\nRecruitment was outsourced causing detrimental effects to the business and health and wellbeing of staff.. constant overtime for an entire 2 years, 2 years of only taking 3/5 weeks of annual leave and no support when you advise of stress and burnout.. and the depression they caused\nSupport...	Ensure to get results to fix valid staff morale issues and is actually a legal requirement under the health and safety act for staff welfare.\nMake sure staff dont breach the working time directive -if they do get an opt out!

Many times making the pitch as I was taught was more likely to hurt, rather than help the sale.	0	0	\N	\N	0.2	0.2	-0.6	0.6	-0.31999999999999995
